Schrodingers Shooter

Schrodinger's shooter is a shooter game that has every and no feature all at once.
2D/3D, good/bad graphics, bots/no bots. 
No one will know until the project is presented when all the possible states collapse into one.


When you play the game, it collapses into a state of a semi-3D top down shooter. Your goal is to survive
as much as you possibly can against a horde of swarming bots that come for you in waves. Bots may drop something upon
thier deaths to make things easier for you.
